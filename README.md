# The objective of this project is to analyse real-time data regarding Covid-19 cases in India.
# Data Source: https://www.mohfw.gov.in/data/datanew.json

# In this project, the data is first extracted from the given source using df command.
# Then we understand the data and the various points in the data by sorting and filtering using python.

# After that, we extract the needed data from the entire dataset to start our analysis and visualization.

# We have used Pairplot to get a scatter plot of the data.
# Similarly, various other graphs and pie charts have been plotted using the seaborn library.
